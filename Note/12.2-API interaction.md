## API interaction
- Performing CRUD operation using HttpClient
- Error handling

#### HttpRequest
HttpRequest is a class in Angular's @angular/common/http module that represents an HTTP request. It can be used to configure and send HTTP requests to a server.

In addition to the `reportProgress` option, there are several other options that can be set in the options object passed to the `HttpRequest` constructor. Here are some of the most commonly used options:
- `headers`: An object representing the headers to be sent with the request. Each key-value pair in the object represents a single header.
- `params`: An object representing the query parameters to be sent with the request. Each key-value pair in the object represents a single query parameter.
- `body`: The request body to be sent with the request. This can be a string, an object, or any other type that can be serialized to JSON or FormData.
- `responseType`: The expected response type. This can be one of several values, including `json`, `text`, `blob`, or `arraybuffer`.
- `withCredentials`: A boolean value indicating whether or not to include credentials (such as cookies or authorization headers) with the request.
- `reportProgress`: A boolean value indicating whether or not to track and report upload or download progress.
- `observe`: The type of response observation to use. This can be one of several values, including `body`, `response`, or `events`.

Here's an example of how to set some of these options:

```typescript
const options = {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer myToken'
  },
  params: {
    'page': '1',
    'per_page': '10'
  },
  body: {
    'username': 'john',
    'password': 'secret'
  },
  responseType: 'text',
  withCredentials: true,
  reportProgress: true,
  observe: 'response'
};

const req = new HttpRequest('POST', '/api/login', options.body, options);
```

In this example, we're setting several options for an HTTP POST request to a login API endpoint. We're setting the `headers` option to include an authorization token, the `params` option to include pagination parameters, the `body` option to include the login credentials, the `responseType` option to expect a text response, the `withCredentials` option to include credentials, the `reportProgress` option to track progress, and the `observe` option to get the full response object.
