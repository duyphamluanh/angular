Content projection is a technique used in web development to allow a component to project its content into another component. This is typically achieved using a slot element in the component's template that can be filled with content from the component's parent element.

Content projection allows for greater flexibility and reusability in component-based architectures, as it enables components to be composed of other components and for the content of those components to be customized without modifying the component itself.
In Angular, content projection is achieved using the ng-content directive, which is used to define a slot in a component's template. The content that is projected into the slot is then passed as a child element of the component in the parent component's template.
Overall, content projection is a powerful technique for building reusable and composable components in web development.
