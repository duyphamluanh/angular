In RxJS, pipe sync is used to synchronize the execution of observables by waiting for the previous observable to complete before subscribing to the next one. This can be useful in situations where you need to ensure that the observables are executed in a specific order or when you need to pass data between observables.
```html
<div *ngIf="rooms$ | async as rooms">
    <app-rooms-list [rooms]="rooms" (selectedRoom)="selectRoom($event)" (deletedRoom)="deleteRoom($event)" [title]="title"></app-rooms-list>
</div>
```
