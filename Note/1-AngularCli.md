# Installation
To install the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface), you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed first. Here are the steps to install Angular CLI:
1. First, open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:
    ```
        npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
    This command will download and install the latest version of Angular CLI on your system.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Angular CLI has been installed by running the following command:
    ```
        ng version
    ```
    This command will display the version of Angular CLI installed on your system.

## Boilerplate code
- In software development, boilerplate code refers to the sections of code that must be included in many places with little or no alteration. This can include things like import statements, basic file structure, and configuration files.
- Boilerplate code can be tedious to write and maintain, especially in larger projects. That's where tools like the Angular CLI come in handy. The CLI generates boilerplate code for you, so you don't have to write it all from scratch.
- For example, when you create a new Angular project using the CLI, it generates a basic file structure and configuration files for you. This includes files like `package.json`, `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and the initial component and app module files.
- The boilerplate code generated by the Angular CLI provides a starting point for your application, which you can then customize and build upon to create your final product. This can save you a lot of time and effort, especially when starting a new project or working with a new technology.
- In addition to generating initial project files, the Angular CLI can also generate boilerplate code for specific Angular features such as components, services, and modules. This can help you get started with these features quickly and easily, without having to write all the code from scratch.
Overall, boilerplate code is an essential part of software development, and tools like the Angular CLI can help you generate and manage boilerplate code more efficiently.

## Angualar workspace
In Angular, a workspace is a collection of projects and related configuration files. A workspace provides a way to manage multiple related projects in a single environment, and to share resources and dependencies among those projects.
When you create an Angular workspace using the Angular CLI, it generates a set of default files and directories that provide a basic framework for organizing your projects and resources. Here's a brief overview of the key components of an Angular workspace:
1. `angular.json`: This file contains the configuration for your workspace and its projects, including settings for build and test tools, development servers, and other options.
2. `package.json`: This file contains the dependencies and scripts for your workspace and its projects. It is used by the Node Package Manager (npm) to manage and install dependencies.
3. `node_modules`: This directory contains the installed dependencies for your workspace and its projects. It is created and managed by npm.
4. `projects`: This directory contains the subdirectories for each project in your workspace. Each project is a separate Angular application or library, and has its own set of files and configuration.
5. `src`: This directory contains the source files for your workspace and its projects, including the main entry point for each project (`main.ts`), the root component for each project (`app.component.ts`), and other related files.
6. `e2e`: This directory contains the end-to-end (e2e) tests for your workspace and its projects. These tests are used to ensure that your application behaves correctly from the user's perspective.
Overall, an Angular workspace provides a powerful and flexible way to manage multiple related projects and resources. It allows you to share code, resources, and dependencies across projects, and to streamline the development process by providing a common framework and structure for your codebase.

## Create a Application
To create an empty Angular workspace using the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface), you can use the ng new command with the --create-application=false option. Here are the steps:
1. Open your Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the workspace.
3. Run the following command to create the empty workspace:
    `
        ng new <workspace-name> --create-application=false
    `
    or
    `
        ng new <workspace-name> 
    `
4. The Angular CLI will prompt you to answer a few questions about your project. You can press Enter to accept the default values for most of these questions, or provide your own values if you prefer.
5. Once the workspace is generated, navigate into the workspace directory using the cd command:
    `
        cd <workspace-name>
    `
6. Now you can use the __ng generate__ command to create new projects, modules, components, services, and other Angular artifacts within your workspace.
7. To generate a new Angular application within your workspace, you can run the following command:
    `
        ng generate application <app-name>
    `

## Angular artifacts
In Angular, an artifact is any component, directive, service, pipe, or module that is used to build an application. These artifacts are the building blocks of an Angular application, and they can be composed together to create more complex functionality.
Here's a brief overview of each type of Angular artifact:
__Components:__ Components are used to __create UI elements and to encapsulate functionality and behavior__. They typically consist of a template that defines the HTML structure of the component, a class that defines the component's behavior, and a set of styles that define the component's appearance.
    `
        ng generate component <component-name>
    `
or
    `
        ng g c <component-name> 
    `
This command will create a new component with the specified name and generate the necessary files, including a __TypeScript class__, an __HTML template__, and a __CSS file__.

__Directives:__ Directives are used to __add behavior to existing DOM elements__. They can be used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element, or to add new functionality to it.
    `
        ng generate directive <directive-name>
    `
    or
    `
        ng g d <directive-name>
    `
This command will create a new directive with the specified name and generate the necessary files, including a __TypeScript class__ and a __test file__.

__Services:__ Services are used to share data and functionality across components in an application. They typically provide a set of methods or properties that can be used by other components to access shared data or functionality.
    `
        ng generate service <service-name>
    `
    or
    `
        ng g s <service-name>
    `
This command will create a new service with the specified name and generate the necessary files, including a __TypeScript class__ and a __test file__.

__Pipes__: Pipes are used to transform data in a template before it is displayed. They can be used to format dates and numbers, filter lists, and perform other transformations on data.
    `
        ng generate pipe <pipe-name>
    `
    or
    `
        ng g p <pipe-name>
    `
This command will create a new pipe with the specified name and generate the necessary files, including a __TypeScript class__ and a __test file__.

__Modules__: Modules are used to organize an application into functional blocks of code. They typically consist of a set of related components, directives, services, and pipes, as well as any other dependencies that are needed to provide the functionality of the module.
    `
        ng generate module <module-name>
    `
    or
    `
        ng g m <module-name>
    `
This command will create a new module with the specified name and generate the necessary files, including a __TypeScript class__, an __NgModule decorator__, and an __exports array__.

__Tạo environments:__
`
ng g environments
`
