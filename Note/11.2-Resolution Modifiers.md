## Resolution modifiers
- Self
- SkipSelf
- Optional
- Host

In the context of dependency injection, resolution modifiers are annotations or configuration options that allow you to modify how dependencies are resolved and injected into components or services. 
There are several common resolution modifiers that are used in various dependency injection frameworks, including:

1. __@Inject__: This annotation is used to specify a particular dependency when multiple dependencies of the same type are available. For example, if you have two implementations of an interface, you can use __@Inject__ to tell the dependency injection framework which implementation to use.
```typescript
import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService } from './user.service';
import { UserServiceImplA } from './user-service-impl-a';
import { UserServiceImplB } from './user-service-impl-b';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-list',
  templateUrl: './user-list.component.html',
  providers: [
    { provide: UserService, useClass: UserServiceImplA },
    { provide: UserService, useClass: UserServiceImplB },
  ]
})
export class UserListComponent {
  users: any[];
  
  constructor(@Inject(UserService) private userService: UserService) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    this.users = this.userService.getUsers();
  }
}
```

2. __@Optional__: This annotation is used to indicate that a dependency is optional, and that the component or service should still be created even if the dependency cannot be resolved. This can be useful in cases where a component or service has optional dependencies that may or may not be present.
```typescript
import { Component, Optional } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-list',
  templateUrl: './user-list.component.html',
})
export class UserListComponent {
  users: any[];
  
  constructor(@Optional() private userService: UserService) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    if (this.userService) {
      this.users = this.userService.getUsers();
    } else {
      // handle case when userService is not available
    }
  }
}
```

3. __@Self__: This annotation is used to limit the search for a dependency to the component or service itself, rather than searching up the dependency injection hierarchy. This can be useful in cases where a component or service needs to access a specific instance of a dependency that is only present within its own context.
```typescript
import { Component, Self } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  providers: [
    { provide: UserService, useValue: { name: 'ChildUserService' } }
  ]
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(@Self() private userService: UserService) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(this.userService.name); // Output: ChildUserService
  }
}
```


4. __@SkipSelf__: This annotation is used to skip the search for a dependency in the current component or service, and instead search up the dependency injection hierarchy. This can be useful in cases where a component or service needs to access a dependency that is provided by a parent component or service.
```typescript
import { Component, SkipSelf } from '@angular/core';
import { UserService } from './user.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(@SkipSelf() private userService: UserService) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(this.userService.getName()); // Output: ParentUserService
  }
}
```

5. __@Host__: This annotation is used to limit the search for a dependency to the closest host component, rather than searching up the dependency injection hierarchy. This can be useful in cases where a component or service needs to access a dependency that is provided by a specific host component.
```typescript
import { Component, Host, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { ThemeService } from './theme.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  providers: [ { provide: ThemeService, useValue: { name: 'ChildThemeService' } } ]
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(@Host() @Inject(ThemeService) private themeService: ThemeService) {}
  
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(this.themeService.name); // Output: ChildThemeService
  }
}
```
By using __@Host__, we can ensure that a child component is only using the service provided by the specific host component that we want, rather than using the service provided by any other ancestor component in the hierarchy. This can be useful in cases where we want to limit the scope of a service to a specific host component, rather than making it available to all components in the hierarchy.

These resolution modifiers can help to fine-tune how dependencies are resolved and injected into components or services, and can be especially useful in large or complex applications where there may be multiple instances of the same type of dependency.
