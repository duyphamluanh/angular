#### HTTP Interceptors
HTTP Interceptors is a special type of angular service that we can implement. It's used to apply custom logic to the central point between the client-side and server-side outgoing/incoming HTTP request and response. Keep in mind that the interceptor wants only HTTP requests.
```
                request                       request
            --------------->             --------------->
Angular App                  Interceptors                 Server 
            <---------------             <---------------
                response                      response
```
Operations of HTTP Interceptor
- Modify HTTP headers
- Modifying the request body
- Set authentication/authorization token
- Modify the HTTP response
- Error handling

Add HTTP Interceptor
```
ng generate interceptor headers
ng generate interceptor response
```

Add HTTP Interceptor to app.module.js
```typescript
providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_SERVICE_CONFIG,
      useValue: APP_CONFIG
    }, 
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: RequestInterceptor,
      multi: true
    },
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: HeadersInterceptor,
      multi: true
    },
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: ResponseInterceptor,
      multi: true
    }
],
```

#### APP_INITIALIZER
... allows you to inject function as application startup
APP_INITIALIZER is an Angular token that provides a way to run one or more functions before the application is fully initialized. This is useful when you need to perform some initialization tasks, such as fetching data from a server, before your application starts.
When you provide a function to the APP_INITIALIZER token, Angular will run the function(s) during the application startup process, before the main application module is instantiated. The function(s) will run in the order in which they are provided, and Angular will not proceed with the application initialization until all of the functions have completed.
