In Angular, directives are a way to extend the functionality of HTML elements and attributes. 
Directives allow you to add behavior to existing elements or create new ones all together.
- Directives are use to change the behavior and appearance of DOM element.
- Directives can implement all __lifecycle hooks__
- Directives __can not have template__

There are three types of directives:

1. __Component Directives__: A Component Directive is used to create reusable UI components in Angular. Components are composed of a template and a class that controls the behavior of the template.

2. __Attribute Directives__: An Attribute Directive is used to change the behavior or appearance of an element, component, or another directive. Attribute Directives are applied to elements as an attribute, such as [ngClass] or [ngStyle].

3. __Structural Directives__: A Structural Directive is used to change the structure of the HTML layout by adding or removing elements from the DOM. Structural Directives are applied to elements as an attribute with a leading asterisk, such as *ngIf or *ngFor.
