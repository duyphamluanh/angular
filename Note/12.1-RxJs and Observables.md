# RxJs
- RxJs is library for writing Reactive Programming
- RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
- RxJs works on a push architecture
- The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:
```
    Observable: represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.
    Observer: is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
    Subscription: represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
    Operators: are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.
    Subject: is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
    Schedulers: are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.
```
Traditional sequential Data Flow:
    
    Get data --> add/update data -> Get data 
        -> Data                         -> New Data
Stream-based Data Flow be like:

    Get data                        --> Add Data
    --> continuos __Stream of data__        --> __Stream of data__ updated 
- We using `.subscribe` to get the observables from api
# Observables
- Observables are stream of data to which we can subscribe
- An Observable is a __fundamental__ concept in Reactive Programming. In Angular, Observable is used extensively for __asynchronous programming, especially when dealing with HTTP requests, animations, and event handling__.
